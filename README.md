# Efficient-Stuttering-Event-Detection

This is the official implementatation of the architecture proposed in the paper "EFFICIENT STUTTERING EVENT DETECTION USING SIAMESE NETWORKS" in ICASSP 2023.
A sample dataset is provided to help you get started with the small-scale pretraining for speech disfluency applications.
